## Browser Fingerprinting and Bypass Techniques 

This repository provides a set of tools for bypassing and evading browser fingerprinting techniques. Browser fingerprinting is a method used to track and identify users based on their browser and system characteristics. This project offers solutions for both client-side and server-side implementations to help mitigate such tracking.

### Files

- **`bypass_browser_fingerprint.py`**: A Python script that utilizes various techniques to obfuscate or modify browser fingerprint data. This script can be used in conjunction with web scraping or testing environments where fingerprint evasion is desired.

- **`fingerprint_browser.js`**: A JavaScript file that demonstrates how to collect and analyze browser fingerprint data. This script serves as a reference for understanding how fingerprinting is performed and can be used to test the effectiveness of the Python tool.

### Features

- **Python Script**: Provides methods for bypassing browser fingerprinting through various obfuscation and evasion techniques.
- **JavaScript Example**: Shows how browser fingerprinting is collected, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the fingerprinting process and how to counteract it.


### Disclaimer

This tool is intended for educational and testing purposes only. Users should ensure their activities comply with all relevant laws and website terms of service. Misuse of fingerprinting or evasion techniques may violate legal or ethical guidelines.
